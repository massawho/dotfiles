# dotfiles

Personal configuration files for an Arch-based Linux setup running i3wm. This repository is built around the idea that after a fresh format, a single `make install` should be enough to get back to a working state — no manual copying, no hunting for config files across the filesystem.

The approach is simple: the repo mirrors the home directory structure, and `make install` creates symlinks from the expected locations into the repo. Editing a config file in either place works the same way because they are the same file.

## What is covered

| Config | Location | `make` target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| i3 | `~/.config/i3` | `install-i3` | Includes i3blocks, keybindings, and all scripts |
| dunst | `~/.config/dunst` | `install-dunst` | Notification daemon |
| rofi | `~/.config/rofi` | `install-rofi` | Launcher and power menu themes |
| rofi themes | `~/.local/share/rofi/themes` | `install-rofi-themes` | Arc dark and Catppuccin palettes |
| xfce4-terminal | `~/.config/xfce4/terminal` | `install-xfce4-terminal` | Config and Catppuccin color schemes |
| vim | `~/.vimrc` | `install-vim` | vim-plug, auto-installs plugins on first launch |

## Install

Clone the repo and run `make install`. The Makefile expects to run from the repo root because it uses `$(shell pwd)` to resolve symlink targets — so `make -C ~/dotfiles install` also works if you prefer not to `cd` first.

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
make install
```

If a config already exists at the target location, the Makefile backs it up with a `.bak` suffix before creating the symlink, so nothing gets silently overwritten.

Individual targets work too if you only want part of it:

```bash
make install-i3
make install-vim
```

## Theming

Themes are switched with `make theme` or `$mod+F2`, which opens a rofi menu to pick from the available options. Switching applies to i3 (bar and window borders), dunst (notification background and frame), and rofi simultaneously, then reloads both.

Available themes:

- `arc-dark` — the EndeavourOS default, dark navy
- `catppuccin-mocha` — warm dark gray
- `catppuccin-macchiato` — cool dark blue-gray
- `catppuccin-frappe` — medium dark gray
- `catppuccin-latte` — light

Active theme selection is intentionally not committed — each machine manages its own independently. `make install` marks the relevant files with `git update-index --skip-worktree` so theme switches never show as dirty.

For xfce4-terminal, Catppuccin color schemes (mocha, macchiato, frappe, latte) are available under **Edit → Preferences → Colors → Load Presets** after install. The theme switcher does not touch the terminal.

## Vim

The vim config uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and bootstraps itself — if `~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim` does not exist when you open vim for the first time, it downloads vim-plug and runs `:PlugInstall` automatically. You just need `curl` available, which it will be on any standard Arch install.

Plugins included:

- `tpope/vim-fugitive` — git integration
- `ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim` — fuzzy file/buffer finder (`<C-t>`)
- `vim-airline/vim-airline` — status line
- `easymotion/vim-easymotion` — motion shortcuts
- `airblade/vim-gitgutter` — git diff in the sign column
- `editorconfig/editorconfig-vim` — respects `.editorconfig` files
- `elixir-editors/vim-elixir` — Elixir syntax and indentation
- `HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim` — TypeScript syntax
- `vim-ruby/vim-ruby` + `nelstrom/vim-textobj-rubyblock` — Ruby support
- `tpope/vim-markdown`, `kana/vim-textobj-user`, `kana/vim-textobj-lastpat`

TypeScript and JavaScript files default to 2-space indentation. Everything else follows `.editorconfig` if one is present, or falls back to 4-space tabs. Colors inherit from the terminal palette rather than hardcoding 256-color values.

## What is not covered yet

These files are committed but have no `make install` target and have not been reviewed:

- `.zshrc`, `.bash_aliases` — shell config, still the old version
- `.xinitrc`, `.Xresources` — X session startup
- `bin/conky-i3bar` — conky bar script
- `.config/termite/` — termite is deprecated, probably not worth keeping
- `.config/sublime-text-3/` — old Sublime Text 3 config
- `pacman.txt` — a package list snapshot, not wired into anything

There is no dependency install script yet. A few things the configs assume are present (autotiling, xbacklight, dunst, rofi, i3blocks, pactl) but are not verified or installed automatically. That is a known gap.
